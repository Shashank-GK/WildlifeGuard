# WildlifeGuard: Intelligent Wildlife and Forest Monitoring System.

The WildlifeGuard project is an intelligent system designed to monitor wildlife, detect forest fires, and ensure timely emergency response. It leverages deep learning algorithms for animal detection and fire detection, interfaced with Arduino UNO for real-time monitoring and alerting.

## Overview

The project addresses the following key objectives:

1. **Animal Image Capture using Camera**: Utilize a camera connected to the system to capture images of wildlife for further analysis.

2. **Animal Detection**:
   - Implement deep learning models (e.g., YOLOv5) to detect animals in the captured images.
   - Provide real-time monitoring of wildlife presence and behavior.

3. **Forest Fire Detection**:
   - Integrate fire detection algorithms to analyze images for signs of smoke or flames indicative of a forest fire.
   - Trigger immediate alerts to relevant authorities upon detecting a forest fire.

4. **Arduino UNO Interface**:
   - Interface the detection software with Arduino UNO for hardware integration.
   - Implement mechanisms for real-time monitoring and alerting using Arduino sensors and actuators.

## Features

- Capture images of animals using a connected camera for analysis.
- Detect animals in the captured images using deep learning models.
- Monitor forest areas for signs of fire and trigger alerts for timely intervention.
- Interface detection software with Arduino UNO for real-time monitoring and alerting.
